# ArticleDatabaseConnector

Hello! 


This is a generic ASP .NET Core Web API create solely to demonstrate knowledge in C# Patterns, OpenAPI, and Entity Framework. 

The Data used is included in the mocl class but also in the EF context. And the migrations are included as well. 

To install: 


Change The Connection String in appsettings.json to reflect an actual SQL server on your local network (Or anywhere else) 

Make sure you also Update-Database in your Nuget / Powershell / cmd to seed the data. 

Also included is an API consumer application.
